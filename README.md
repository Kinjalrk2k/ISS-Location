### Notes
This project was created and tested under Windows, and is expected to work fully in other systems too.

This project is still under development. Parts of the source codes may not be well documented.
Also suitable prompts may not be available for the user at the moment.

More features and fixes are yet to come. Meanwhile suggestions, ideas, bug reports are welcomed.

I am a python n00bie! I am still learning python! I have tried my best to give in as much effort required (of course directly proportionate to my knowledge), for this project.
